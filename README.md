Regular expressions in-class exercise based on XKCD cartoon

![Your mission](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png)

## HOWTO

File `detective.py` is the skeleton code.  It reads lines of
text from `clues.txt` and prints any part of a line that
matches `CLUE_PATTERN`.  The initial clue pattern just
matches integers. 

* Part 1:  Modify `CLUE_PATTERN` to match email addresses

* Part 2:  Modify `CLUE_PATTERN` to match street addresses.
            This is harder.
